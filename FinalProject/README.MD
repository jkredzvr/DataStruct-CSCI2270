### Project Objectives 
- Implement algorithms for standard operations on common data structures and discuss the complexity of the operations.  
- Comment on the features of different traversal methods for graphs and other data structures.  
- Formulate and implement solutions to problems using fundamental graph algorithms e.g. depth-first and breadth-first search and a shortest-path algorithm.

Project Requirements
- Contains at least one class.
- Contains at least one graph and one other data structure that weâ€™ve studied this semester.
- Your class should contain at least 7 public methods.
- Contains a well-documented driver file to run your library code.


### Project Summary
Create a graph network class that allows a person to view relationship/similarities among students of different:
- College Majors
- Interests [ ]
- Skills/Programming Knowledge

Different views of compatibiltiy among students are generated by choosing based
1. Sorted Group 
2. Connection "Edge Criterion"
3. Compatibility "Weight Criterion"

From these network graphs, you could possibly identify/answer
- students with similar skills and similar interests in each College Major
- common Interests and College Majors based on Skills/Programming Knowledge

Public methods allow for
- Adding a new student
- Seeding the graph network with randomized students
- Removing a student from the graph network
- Selecting the criteria for (Sorting the Groups, Connections, and Compatibility)
- Calculating the network of students based the selected criterion

### How to Run
This section contains instructions, with examples, of how to run your program.

### Dependencies
This section contains a description of any dependencies that your program requires.
For example, if your program relies on another third-party library that needs to be
installed, you should provide a description of where to find that library and
instructions for how to install it or a link to installation instructions.

### System Requirements
Is your program for Windows, Mac, Linux? Are there additional system
requirements other than the operating system?


### Open issues/bugs
List any known bugs in the project, and any open enhancement requests.
